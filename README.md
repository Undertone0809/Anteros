# Anteros 🚀

## 🏦 The Robinhood of Attention Markets

Anteros is a groundbreaking platform focused on unlocking the hidden potential of attention markets through tokenization, liquidity, and decentralized prediction models. We're building a new frontier in the world of digital content creators. 🌐✨

## 🌍 Problem Statement

The social media world is dominated by a few big names, but most creators can't access the tools they need to monetize their growth. 🔒

- **Top 1%**: Blue-chip KOLs (Liquid but Saturated) 💎
- **Middle 20%**: Rising creators (No valuation tools) 🌱
- **Base 79%**: Emerging talents (Illiquid "dark matter") 🌑

92% of Twitter creators are unable to monetize their potential. Current solutions are either too centralized or fragmented, leaving many creators behind. 😕
